# Future of Desktop Applications

Had it not been the fact that many tutorials and courses that teach Desktop applications use old and ugly native controls, desktop applications market would have been so much bigger than what it is today.

Consider that we would have had desktop apps for every social media application out there because they would needed to support offline access to the tweets and post. Email Clients, News Apps, just about any web application would have a desktop application because it would be efficient because of it storage capabiiities, the same data wouldn't need to be downloaded twice or more, the logos, profile pictures, streaming apps could have cache partly watched videos so they could resume the download of the data later and not have to download them all over again.

And I haven't even touched on Artificial intelligence and Data Science apps. There are numerous web apps offering motion graphics, logo design, story writing, calender management, financial and trading analysis, medical and scientific analysis, etc,  all those would have been desktop applications. 

And mind you, desktops are not like mobile phones, they support having many application on your machine. Try that on mobile phones you would run out of storage space and ram. Also OS version targetting is a big problem for mobile apps.

So if people developers and IT CEOs knew they would get the same beauty they get with web and mobile for desktops they would be enough reason to have a desktop app s.

With this I say that there is a a future in learning desktop applications, for a developer hoping to get a job, for a startup and for a big corporation.
