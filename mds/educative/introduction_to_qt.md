# Introduction to Qt

Qt is a complete cross-platform framework for building mobile, desktop, embedded and distributed systems applications.

It has objects for managing everything an application will need. From threading to UI elements, from multimedia to 3D rendering.

When it comes to UI elements, it provides QtWidgets which gives you more of a native feel and QML which tends to be more like mobile friendly and its the most customisable to provide you with more modern and sleek UIs.
