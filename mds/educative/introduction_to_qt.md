# Introduction to Qt

Qt is a complete cross-platform framework for building mobile, desktop, embedded and distributed systems applications.

It has objects for managing everything an application will need. From threading to UI elements, from multimedia to 3D rendering.

When it comes to UI elements, it provides QtWidgets which gives you more of a native feel and QML which is for building highly dynamic applications with custom user interfaces..
