# Customizing Buttons

[tex]

## Basic use

The first thing you want to customize is the background property.

`code.txt`

## Background

There is an implicitWidth and implicitHeight if you would like to control the dimensions.

`code1.txt`

When you set the radius to half of both the width and height, you would get a perfect circle



## ContentItem

To control the text that is drawn on top use the contentItem property.

You can use anchors on a contentItem, so we have used horizontalAlignment and verticalAlignment.

`code2.txt`

There is always some kind of padding around the contentItem. You can change it with paddding property or with the individual padding properties such as leftPadding, rightPadding.

## Responding to hover and pressed events

[text]

`code3.txt`

[text]
