# Text Area

[text]

## Basic use

[text]

`code.txt`

The `placeholderText` has a `placeholderTextColor` for modifying its color. But you can ignore it completly.

## customization

It has all the font properties of a Text. It has a color property. The background property is used to modify the property.

`code1.txt`

The text property holds the actual text

`code2.txt`

The textFormat property can be used so that the actual text you send to it will be html formatted text.

`code3.txt`

The textDocument property can be used in python together with QSyntaxHighlighter to handling syntax highlighting. That is beyond the scope of this course.
