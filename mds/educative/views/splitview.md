# SplitView



## Basic Use

[text]

`code.txt`

For the two Rectangles that we have we could have specified SplitView.minimumWidth for just one of them. This will mean you can drag the divider all the way till the second Rectangle disappears, the divider will then be positioned at the edge of the window.

`implicitWidth` also works as specifying sort of a preferred width, it doesn't however work as a minimum width. If you would like a minimum width use SplitView.minimum width instead.
