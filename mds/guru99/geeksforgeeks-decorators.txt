First Class Objects
In Python, functions are first class objects which means that functions in Python can be used or passed as arguments.
Properties of first class functions:
 - A function is an instance of the Object type.
 - You can store the function in a variable.
 - You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
 - You can return the function from a function.
 - You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists,

Decorators
 - Decorator can modify the behaviour
 - Let’s jump to another example where we can easily find out the execution time of a function using a decorator.

What if a function returns something or an argument is passed to the function?
