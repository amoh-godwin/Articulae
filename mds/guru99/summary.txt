Functions in Python

A function is an instance of the Object type.

Assigning a function to a variable

Returning a function from a function

Passing Functions as Arguments to other Functions

A function is an object. Because of that, a function can be assigned to a variable. The function can be accessed from that variable.

Decorators

Introduction to Decorators
 - It is also called meta programming where a part of the program attempts to change another part of program at compile time
 - Passed as an argument
 - Modified
 - Reuse these customised behaviours on multiple functions/classes.
 - Python decorator modify data

Using Python decorators with the @ symbol

Syntax of Python Decorators





Decorating functions with parameters















Singleton Class


The Use Cases of Decorators

 - Authorization
 - Logging
 - Timing Functions
 - Slowing Down Code
 - Slowing Down Code, Revisited
 - Registering Plugins
 - Caching Return Values
 - Adding Information About Units
 - Validating JSON
 - Synchronization

Memoization

Function Catalog
 - Without the registration decorators and function catalog, adding a new activation function would need modification to every function that uses activation.

What is the Decorators Library in Python?

Takeaway
 - A Decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.

 - Higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

Inner Functions

 - Inner functions can access variables in the outer scope of the enclosing function. This pattern is known as a Closure.
