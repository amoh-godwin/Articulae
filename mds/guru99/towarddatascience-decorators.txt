The Simplest Tutorial for Python Decorators
Add a “Pythonic” wrapper of any functions/classes without modifying them

 - Add some behaviours to built-in or third-party functions/classes, so we don’t need to fork and modify the source code.
 - Reuse these customised behaviours on multiple functions/classes.
 - function_decorator is the name of the decorator.
 - wrapped_func is the name of the inner function, which is actually only used in this decorator definition.
 - func is the function that is being decorated.
